### 3.2. Implemented Cascading Filters
- Added dynamic cascading filters with:
  1. City → Project → Surveyor priority
  2. Auto-updating dependent filters
  3. Real-time synchronization

### 3.3. Improved Surveyor Management
- Fixed delete functionality with proper API integration

- Transmits to `/api/live/location` endpoint
- Handles offline scenarios with retry mechanism

### 4.2. API → Database
- RESTful endpoints for all operations
- PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for spatial data
- Proper indexing for performance

### 4.3. Database → Frontend
- Optimized queries for location history
- Spatial queries for geographic operations
- Efficient data serialization

## 5. Key Technical Improvements

### 5.1. Fixed Historical Path Accuracy
- **Problem**: Incomplete or unrealistic paths in Google Maps/OSRM
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced OSRM component to use ALL coordinates from `location_track` table
  - Added polyline drawing with all points
  - Fixed Google Maps integration with all coordinates
  - Removed simplification of start and end points only

### 5.2. Fixed Cascading Filters
- **Problem**: Incomplete, non-dynamic, non-synced filters
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented cascading filters with dynamic data
  - Added real-time synchronization between City → Project → Surveyor
  - Added auto-fill functionality

### 5.3. Fixed Surveyor Delete
- **Problem**: DELETE API returning 404 and data not removed
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed DELETE `/api/surveyors/{id}` endpoint
  - Implemented proper cleanup of associated location tracks
  - Added proper HTTP status codes and error handling

## 6. Data Consistency

### 6.1. Mobile App to API

## 7. Verification and Testing

### 7.1. Automated Testing
- Verified all location points are used in historical routes
- Confirmed cascading filters work in proper priority order
- Validated surveyor delete functionality with data cleanup

### 7.2. Manual Testing
- Verified mobile app collects and sends all GPS points
- Confirmed dashboard displays all location data
- Validated data consistency between all system components

## 8. Performance and Reliability
